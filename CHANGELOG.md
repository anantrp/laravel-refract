## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

First release.

### Added

- Records every Laravel AI SDK agent run as OpenTelemetry spans: `invoke_agent`, `chat` and `execute_tool`. Sub-agents nest under their tool. Failover and tool approvals are events. Streams are traced like `prompt()`.
- OTel GenAI attributes plus `laravel.ai.*`, `session.id`, the run's participant, `service.name` and `deployment.environment.name`. `error.type` on failed spans. Joins an active OpenTelemetry trace.
- Destinations: `otlp` (any OTLP/HTTP JSON backend) and `langfuse`. Redirects are never followed.
- Transports: `sync`, `queue` (async drivers only) and `null`. No network call before the response.
- Opt-in content capture with a byte cap per value and an optional `mask` class. Files and media are never recorded.
- Laravel `Context` keys mapped to span attributes through the config.
- Never breaks the app: guarded listeners, one warning per kind, a 1,000-span buffer cap.
- In a command, queue worker or tinker, finished runs are sent while the process keeps going. Open runs stay whole and keep their state. Web requests send once, after the response.
- One warning when a destination accepts a batch (2xx) but its OTLP `partialSuccess` refuses spans, with the count and the message. Credentials in the message are masked. The refused spans are not retried.
- A batch over 4 MB of OTLP JSON (before gzip) is sent in parts of 4 MB or less, cut between run trees. A span over 4 MB is sent alone with one warning.
- The HTTP timeout is 15 s, so a 4 MB part has time to reach the destination.
- Exports are gzipped with `Content-Encoding: gzip` by default, for both destinations. `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_COMPRESSION=none` turns it off. If gzip fails, the export is sent plain.
- The `queue` job tries 4 times, 10 s, 60 s, then 300 s apart. A `Retry-After` on a 429 or 503 can make it wait longer, at most 300 s.
- Refract is never tied to the app's database transactions. An app rollback does not remove spans.
- A send in the process while a console process runs keeps its spans when the destination fails, and tries them again later. Once a part cannot connect, the later parts of that send wait for the next try.
